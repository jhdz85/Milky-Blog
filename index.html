                    she learned how to pee outside, sit, and bond with hoomans. Her roots will forever be in Southern California.

                    was hard to go on walks and live here. Milky gained many amazing traits other than weight in this city.

                    afraid of the rain. Funnily enough, she refuses to put on a rain jacket. She is averaging 2 mile walks daily (when its not raining).
